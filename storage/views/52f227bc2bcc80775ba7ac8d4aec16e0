<h1>About PainTrackr</h1>
<section class="cf">
	<article class="">
	<p>PainTrackr is an open-source app that monitors physical pain. It logs pain based on severity and location and stores
this data so that it can be easily transmitted.</p> 

	<p>PainTrackr seeks to make logging pain more intuitive, while eliminating the hassle of inputting information via pen and paper. By providing a way for patients to easily enter data about their bodily pains, PainTrackr hopes to improve communication between patients and their healthcare providers.</p>

	<p>PainTrackr was developed by <a href="http://www.goinvo.com">Involution Studios</a>, a full-service app design shop focusing on apps for web, mobile and 
desktop devices. Founded in 2004, Involution has created apps for some of the best software companies in the world, 
including Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, and has produced applications that are being used every day by over 150
million users.</p>
